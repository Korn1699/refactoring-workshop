# Installation Instructions

## Requirements
- Node > v10.13
- Git

## Installation
1. Clone the repo and change to the directory of the project
2. `npm install`
3. `npm install json-server`
4. In a terminal window run `npm start`
5. In another terminal window run `npm run api`
6. To start at the beginning checkout the first tag: `git checkout 01-Base`

## Problems?
If that doesn't work out, there are a series of code sandboxes. They do not have
a working api server but are otherwise identical.

Start with the [base project](https://codesandbox.io/s/refactoring-02-tmh62
)
